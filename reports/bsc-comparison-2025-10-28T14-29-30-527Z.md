## 🌐 Network Characteristics

- **Network**: BSC Testnet
- **Consensus Algorithm**: Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA)
- **Finality Type**: Probabilistic
- **Average Block Time**: 3 seconds
- **Fee Structure**: Gas-based (Gwei)
- **Throughput**: 100 TPS average

## 💪 Strengths

- Reasonable confirmation times under 15 seconds
- Mature ecosystem with extensive tooling
- EVM compatibility enables easy migration
- Large developer community and resources

## 🔧 Challenges

- Variable gas fees based on network congestion
- Probabilistic finality requires multiple confirmations
- Lower theoretical throughput compared to Hedera
