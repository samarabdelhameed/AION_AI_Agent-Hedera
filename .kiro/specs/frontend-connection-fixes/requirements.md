# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical connection and configuration issues preventing the AION frontend from properly integrating with the MCP Agent backend and Web3 infrastructure. The frontend is currently experiencing connection refused errors, Web3 configuration problems, and data handling issues that prevent the application from functioning properly.

The goal is to establish reliable connections between all system components and ensure the frontend can successfully fetch real data from both the MCP Agent backend and blockchain contracts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: MCP Agent Backend Connection Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to successfully connect to the MCP Agent backend, so that real market data and AI decisions can be displayed in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend starts THEN the system SHALL successfully connect to the MCP Agent backend at the correct port
2. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL receive valid responses from all MCP Agent endpoints
3. WHEN the MCP Agent is not running THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback data
4. WHEN API endpoints are unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation with cached or mock data
5. WHEN connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically resume real data fetching

### Requirement 2: Web3 Configuration Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my wallet and interact with smart contracts without configuration errors, so that I can use all DeFi features of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting a wallet THEN the system SHALL successfully establish Web3 connection without "config.getClient" errors
2. WHEN reading contract data THEN the system SHALL successfully fetch balances, shares, and vault information
3. WHEN switching networks THEN the system SHALL automatically update contract addresses and configurations
4. WHEN executing transactions THEN the system SHALL properly estimate gas and execute without configuration errors
5. WHEN contracts are not deployed THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about network status

### Requirement 3: API Endpoint Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API calls to use consistent endpoints and error handling, so that the frontend reliably communicates with backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL use the correct MCP Agent URL from environment variables
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN responses are received THEN the system SHALL handle both success and error cases gracefully
4. WHEN data is null or undefined THEN the system SHALL prevent null reference errors with proper validation
5. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading states and timeouts

### Requirement 4: Data Validation and Error Prevention

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle missing or invalid data gracefully, so that I can continue using the application even when some services are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN market data is null THEN the system SHALL provide fallback data or clear loading states
2. WHEN API responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL validate data structure before processing
3. WHEN contract calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN data is stale THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate data freshness and last update time
5. WHEN multiple services fail THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical functionality and degrade gracefully

### Requirement 5: Development Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear instructions and automated setup for running the complete system, so that I can quickly start development and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the system SHALL provide clear startup instructions for all services
2. WHEN starting the MCP Agent THEN the system SHALL run on the correct port with proper configuration
3. WHEN starting the frontend THEN the system SHALL connect to all required services automatically
4. WHEN services are not running THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with startup instructions
5. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide default values or clear configuration guidance

### Requirement 6: Real-time Data Flow Establishment

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see live data updates from protocols and contracts, so that I can make informed investment decisions based on current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL fetch and display real market data from Venus, PancakeSwap, and other protocols
2. WHEN viewing vault information THEN the system SHALL show live balances and yields from smart contracts
3. WHEN data updates THEN the system SHALL refresh the UI with new information automatically
4. WHEN real-time updates fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to periodic polling with clear status indicators
5. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL show data source, freshness, and reliability indicators

### Requirement 7: Error Recovery and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to recover from temporary failures and continue working, so that brief network issues don't disrupt my DeFi activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN services become unavailable THEN the system SHALL switch to fallback data sources
3. WHEN connections are restored THEN the system SHALL automatically resume normal operation
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate information for debugging while maintaining user privacy
5. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL provide clear recovery instructions and support contact information

### Requirement 8: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast loading times and responsive interactions, so that I can efficiently manage my DeFi investments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and progress indicators
2. WHEN data is cached THEN the system SHALL display cached data immediately while fetching updates
3. WHEN multiple requests are needed THEN the system SHALL batch or parallelize requests for better performance
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL prioritize loading critical data first
5. WHEN interactions occur THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and optimistic updates where appropriate
