# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for deploying the AION AI DeFi Agent project to BNB Smart Chain mainnet. The project is currently running successfully on BSC testnet and has received positive feedback from BNB Chain team. The deployment needs to be comprehensive, secure, and cost-effective while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Smart Contract Deployment

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to deploy all necessary smart contracts to BSC mainnet, so that users can interact with real DeFi protocols and earn actual yields.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to mainnet THEN the system SHALL deploy the AIONVault contract with proper initialization parameters
2. WHEN deploying strategy contracts THEN the system SHALL deploy Venus, PancakeSwap, Aave, and Beefy strategy adapters
3. WHEN contracts are deployed THEN the system SHALL verify all contracts on BSCScan for transparency
4. IF any deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback procedures
5. WHEN all contracts are deployed THEN the system SHALL configure proper access controls and security parameters

### Requirement 2: Minimal Cost Deployment Strategy

**User Story:** As a project owner with limited budget, I want to deploy only essential contracts first, so that I can launch with minimal cost and expand later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying phase 1 THEN the system SHALL deploy only AIONVault and StrategyVenus contracts
2. WHEN calculating costs THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most cost-effective deployment approach
3. WHEN estimating budget THEN the system SHALL provide options for phased deployment
4. IF budget is limited THEN the system SHALL suggest starting with single strategy (Venus only)
5. WHEN phase 1 is successful THEN the system SHALL allow adding more strategies incrementally

### Requirement 3: Security and Risk Management

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to ensure maximum security for mainnet deployment, so that user funds are protected and the system is resilient against attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to mainnet THEN the system SHALL implement all security measures from the audit checklist
2. WHEN contracts are live THEN the system SHALL have emergency pause mechanisms available
3. WHEN handling user funds THEN the system SHALL use proven security patterns (ReentrancyGuard, Ownable, Pausable)
4. IF security issues are detected THEN the system SHALL have circuit breakers to protect funds
5. WHEN operations are running THEN the system SHALL monitor for unusual activity and potential attacks

### Requirement 4: Protocol Integration Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to work seamlessly with real DeFi protocols on mainnet, so that I can earn actual yields from Venus, PancakeSwap, and other platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with Venus THEN the system SHALL use real vBNB contracts and earn actual lending yields
2. WHEN integrating with PancakeSwap THEN the system SHALL provide real liquidity and earn trading fees
3. WHEN switching strategies THEN the system SHALL seamlessly move funds between protocols
4. IF any protocol is unhealthy THEN the system SHALL detect issues and prevent deposits
5. WHEN calculating yields THEN the system SHALL use real-time APY data from protocol contracts

### Requirement 5: Frontend and Backend Migration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend application to work with mainnet contracts, so that I can deposit real BNB and manage my investments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend loads THEN the system SHALL connect to mainnet contracts instead of testnet
2. WHEN users connect wallets THEN the system SHALL prompt for BSC mainnet network
3. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL show real balances, yields, and transaction history
4. IF users are on wrong network THEN the system SHALL guide them to switch to BSC mainnet
5. WHEN transactions are submitted THEN the system SHALL use appropriate gas limits for mainnet

### Requirement 6: AI Agent Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AI agent to work with mainnet protocols, so that it can make real investment decisions and optimize yields automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI agent starts THEN the system SHALL connect to mainnet RPC endpoints
2. WHEN analyzing yields THEN the system SHALL fetch real APY data from mainnet protocols
3. WHEN making decisions THEN the system SHALL consider real gas costs and slippage
4. IF market conditions change THEN the system SHALL automatically rebalance portfolios
5. WHEN executing transactions THEN the system SHALL use secure private key management

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want comprehensive monitoring of the mainnet deployment, so that I can track performance, detect issues, and optimize operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system is live THEN the system SHALL monitor all contract interactions and transactions
2. WHEN users deposit/withdraw THEN the system SHALL track TVL, user count, and transaction volume
3. WHEN yields are generated THEN the system SHALL calculate and display performance metrics
4. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators

### Requirement 8: Documentation and User Guidance

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear documentation and guidance for using the mainnet version, so that I can safely interact with the system and understand the risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users visit the platform THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for mainnet usage
2. WHEN users make transactions THEN the system SHALL display real costs and risks
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and solutions
4. IF users need help THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive documentation and FAQs
5. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL update documentation accordingly
