# MCP Agent Mainnet Testing Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines comprehensive testing requirements for the AION MCP Agent to ensure all functions work correctly on mainnet with real data. The testing will validate that every API endpoint, service, and integration point functions properly with live blockchain data and external APIs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Mainnet Connectivity Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the MCP agent can connect to BSC mainnet and fetch real blockchain data, so that the system works reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL successfully connect to BSC mainnet RPC endpoints
2. WHEN requesting current block number THEN the system SHALL return a valid block number greater than 0
3. WHEN fetching gas prices THEN the system SHALL return current mainnet gas prices in gwei
4. WHEN connecting to multiple RPC endpoints THEN the system SHALL handle failover between providers
5. IF an RPC endpoint fails THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to backup endpoints

### Requirement 2: Real Market Data Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to fetch accurate real-time market data from live sources, so that investment decisions are based on current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting BNB price THEN the system SHALL fetch real price data from Binance API
2. WHEN fetching protocol data THEN the system SHALL retrieve live TVL and APY from DeFiLlama
3. WHEN requesting Venus data THEN the system SHALL fetch real Venus protocol metrics
4. WHEN requesting PancakeSwap data THEN the system SHALL fetch real DEX metrics
5. WHEN requesting Beefy data THEN the system SHALL fetch real vault performance data
6. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms
7. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with exponential backoff

### Requirement 3: Smart Contract Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to interact with real smart contracts on mainnet, so that all operations reflect actual on-chain state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading contract state THEN the system SHALL fetch real data from deployed contracts
2. WHEN estimating gas THEN the system SHALL provide accurate gas estimates for mainnet
3. WHEN simulating transactions THEN the system SHALL use real contract addresses and ABIs
4. WHEN checking balances THEN the system SHALL return actual wallet balances from mainnet
5. WHEN reading Venus contracts THEN the system SHALL fetch real supply/borrow rates
6. IF contracts are not deployed THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with fallback data

### Requirement 4: Oracle Service Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all oracle endpoints to return accurate real-time data, so that the AI agent makes informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling /api/oracle/snapshot THEN the system SHALL return real market data within 30 seconds TTL
2. WHEN calling /api/oracle/historical THEN the system SHALL return real historical protocol data
3. WHEN requesting protocol metrics THEN the system SHALL aggregate data from multiple real sources
4. WHEN data is cached THEN the system SHALL serve cached data within TTL limits
5. WHEN cache expires THEN the system SHALL fetch fresh data from live sources
6. WHEN multiple protocols are requested THEN the system SHALL return consistent data structure

### Requirement 5: API Endpoint Functionality

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want all API endpoints to work correctly with real data, so that the user interface displays accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling GET /api/health THEN the system SHALL return comprehensive health status
2. WHEN calling GET /api/vault/stats THEN the system SHALL return real vault performance metrics
3. WHEN calling POST /api/execute THEN the system SHALL simulate real transaction execution
4. WHEN calling POST /api/decide THEN the system SHALL return AI recommendations based on real data
5. WHEN calling GET /api/proof-of-yield/snapshot THEN the system SHALL return real yield metrics
6. WHEN calling GET /api/transactions THEN the system SHALL return real transaction history
7. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL return proper error responses

### Requirement 6: Performance Under Load

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to maintain performance under realistic load conditions, so that it can handle production traffic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling 100 concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds
2. WHEN processing sustained load THEN the system SHALL maintain 95% success rate
3. WHEN cache is populated THEN subsequent requests SHALL be served within 100ms
4. WHEN APIs are slow THEN the system SHALL timeout gracefully after 10 seconds
5. WHEN memory usage increases THEN the system SHALL implement proper garbage collection
6. WHEN handling burst traffic THEN the system SHALL queue requests appropriately

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and recover automatically, so that temporary issues don't break the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external APIs fail THEN the system SHALL return cached data with stale flag
2. WHEN RPC endpoints are down THEN the system SHALL failover to backup providers
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff
4. WHEN invalid data is received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize responses
5. WHEN services crash THEN the system SHALL restart automatically
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information

### Requirement 8: Data Quality Validation

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to ensure all data returned by the system is accurate and consistent, so that analysis and decisions are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching price data THEN values SHALL be within reasonable market ranges
2. WHEN retrieving APY data THEN values SHALL be positive and less than 1000%
3. WHEN getting TVL data THEN values SHALL be greater than $100,000 for major protocols
4. WHEN timestamps are provided THEN they SHALL be in ISO format and recent
5. WHEN protocol health is reported THEN status SHALL be one of: healthy, warning, critical
6. WHEN data is aggregated THEN calculations SHALL be mathematically correct

### Requirement 9: Security and Validation

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want all inputs and outputs to be properly validated and secured, so that the system is protected against attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving API requests THEN the system SHALL validate all input parameters
2. WHEN processing user data THEN the system SHALL sanitize inputs to prevent injection
3. WHEN making external calls THEN the system SHALL validate SSL certificates
4. WHEN handling private keys THEN the system SHALL never log or expose them
5. WHEN rate limiting is active THEN the system SHALL block excessive requests
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL not expose internal system details

### Requirement 10: Monitoring and Metrics

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and metrics collection, so that I can track system performance and health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL collect performance metrics for all endpoints
2. WHEN services start THEN the system SHALL report service health status
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL increment error counters
4. WHEN cache is used THEN the system SHALL track hit/miss ratios
5. WHEN external APIs are called THEN the system SHALL measure response times
6. WHEN memory usage changes THEN the system SHALL track resource consumption
