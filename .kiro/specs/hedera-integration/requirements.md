# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the integration of Hedera Hashgraph services (HTS, HCS, HFS) into the AION DeFi platform to provide native tokenization, immutable audit trails, and decentralized storage capabilities. The integration will enhance transparency, security, and verifiability of AI-driven DeFi operations while maintaining compatibility with existing BSC infrastructure.

## Glossary

- **AION_Vault**: The main smart contract managing user deposits and yield strategies
- **HTS**: Hedera Token Service for native tokenization
- **HCS**: Hedera Consensus Service for immutable message logging
- **HFS**: Hedera File Service for decentralized file storage
- **AI_Agent**: The MCP agent responsible for strategy decisions and execution
- **Share_Token**: HTS token representing user ownership in the vault
- **Decision_Log**: Immutable record of AI decisions stored on HCS
- **Model_Snapshot**: AI model metadata stored on HFS
- **Hedera_Testnet**: Hedera test environment accessible via Hashio relay

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AION_Vault SHALL import and utilize IHederaTokenService interface for HTS operations
2. THE AION_Vault SHALL handle Hedera response codes and provide meaningful error messages
3. THE AION_Vault SHALL interact with HTS precompile at the system contract address
4. THE smart contract SHALL validate all Hedera service responses before proceeding
5. THE AION_Vault SHALL maintain compatibility with existing EVM-based operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AION Vault to be fully compliant with Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS), so that I can ensure high performance and secure isolation from other EVM networks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AION_Vault SHALL use HSCS instead of any generic RPC and be tested via Hashio relay on testnet
2. THE AION_Vault SHALL successfully execute all functions via HSCS (createToken, mint, burn operations)
3. THE project SHALL adopt updated Hedera libraries (v0.38+) in the implementation
4. THE system SHALL implement gas profiling and performance reporting for comparison with BSC
5. THE deployment results SHALL be documented in README or demo for hackathon presentation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the ability to deposit or withdraw assets from BSC or Ethereum to Hedera, so that the project scope extends beyond Hedera-only operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AION_Vault SHALL support bridge adapter functionality (HTS ↔ ERC-20 mapping)
2. THE system SHALL integrate a simple bridge interface (such as Hashport or LayerZero)
3. THE AION_Vault SHALL record all bridging operations on HCS for verification purposes
4. THE demo SHALL demonstrate how ERC-20 shares convert to HTS tokens
5. THE bridge operations SHALL maintain audit trail consistency across chains

5. THE contract SHALL include unit tests for all view functions in Foundry

### Requirement 10
