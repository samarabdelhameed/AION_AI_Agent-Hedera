# Requirements Document - Professional Contracts Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating comprehensive, professional documentation for the AION AI DeFi Platform smart contracts, focusing on Hedera Hashgraph integration and BNB Chain deployment. The documentation will serve as a technical showcase for judges and developers, demonstrating the platform's innovative cross-chain architecture.

## Glossary

- **AION Platform**: The Immortal AI DeFi Agent platform with cross-chain capabilities
- **Hedera Hashgraph**: Enterprise-grade distributed ledger technology with consensus service
- **BNB Chain**: Binance Smart Chain for DeFi operations
- **HCS**: Hedera Consensus Service for immutable logging
- **HTS**: Hedera Token Service for native token operations
- **HFS**: Hedera File Service for metadata storage
- **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Technology enabling asset transfers between networks
- **AI Decision Logger**: System for recording AI-driven investment decisions
- **Strategy Contracts**: Smart contracts implementing various DeFi yield strategies

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a technical judge or developer, I want comprehensive documentation that explains the Hedera integration architecture, so that I can understand the innovative cross-chain capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the documentation, THE documentation SHALL provide a complete technical flowchart showing Hedera integration
2. WHEN examining the architecture, THE documentation SHALL detail all HCS, HTS, and HFS service implementations
3. WHEN studying the integration, THE documentation SHALL explain cross-chain bridge mechanisms
4. WHEN analyzing the system, THE documentation SHALL show real transaction examples and verification links
5. WHERE Hedera services are used, THE documentation SHALL provide live service IDs and network details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed deployment instructions for both BNB Chain and Hedera networks, so that I can deploy and interact with the contracts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying contracts, THE documentation SHALL provide step-by-step deployment commands for each network
2. WHEN configuring networks, THE documentation SHALL list all required RPC URLs and chain IDs
3. WHEN setting up environments, THE documentation SHALL provide complete environment variable configurations
4. WHEN verifying deployments, THE documentation SHALL include contract verification commands
5. WHERE multiple networks are involved, THE documentation SHALL explain network-specific configurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want to see all deployed contract addresses and their verification status, so that I can verify the platform's legitimacy and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing deployments, THE documentation SHALL list all mainnet contract addresses
2. WHEN checking verification, THE documentation SHALL provide block explorer links for each contract
3. WHEN examining testnet deployments, THE documentation SHALL include testnet addresses and links
4. WHEN validating contracts, THE documentation SHALL show verification status on block explorers
5. WHERE contracts interact, THE documentation SHALL map contract relationships and dependencies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a technical evaluator, I want detailed architecture diagrams and technical specifications, so that I can assess the platform's technical sophistication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN studying the architecture, THE documentation SHALL provide comprehensive system architecture diagrams
2. WHEN examining contracts, THE documentation SHALL detail contract interaction patterns
3. WHEN reviewing security, THE documentation SHALL explain security mechanisms and audit trails
4. WHEN analyzing performance, THE documentation SHALL provide gas optimization details
5. WHERE AI integration occurs, THE documentation SHALL explain AI decision logging mechanisms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer or auditor, I want complete command references and testing procedures, so that I can interact with and validate the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing contracts, THE documentation SHALL provide comprehensive testing commands
2. WHEN interacting with contracts, THE documentation SHALL include CLI interaction examples
3. WHEN debugging issues, THE documentation SHALL provide troubleshooting guides
4. WHEN monitoring systems, THE documentation SHALL explain monitoring and logging procedures
5. WHERE automation is available, THE documentation SHALL document automated deployment scripts
