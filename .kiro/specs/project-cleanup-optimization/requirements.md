# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive cleanup, optimization, and integration review of the entire AION project to prepare it for a professional hackathon demo. The goal is to eliminate all unused code, ensure all frontend components are fully integrated with real data from smart contracts and the MCP agent, convert all Arabic comments to English, and create a seamless end-to-end user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Codebase Cleanup and Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want all unused, placeholder, and redundant files removed and all comments in professional English, so that the codebase is clean, maintainable, and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the entire project THEN the system SHALL identify and remove all unused files, components, and assets
2. WHEN reviewing code files THEN the system SHALL remove all commented-out code that is no longer needed
3. WHEN encountering Arabic text in comments THEN the system SHALL convert all comments to professional English
4. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN no Arabic text SHALL remain anywhere in the codebase
5. WHEN reviewing file structure THEN the system SHALL eliminate redundant or duplicate files

### Requirement 2: Frontend Real Data Integration

**User Story:** As a user of the AION platform, I want all frontend components to display real data from contracts and the MCP agent, so that I can see actual yield information and perform real transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visiting any frontend page THEN all displayed data SHALL come from real API calls or contract reads
2. WHEN interacting with buttons and inputs THEN they SHALL be fully integrated with backend services
3. WHEN mock or static data is found THEN it SHALL be replaced with actual API calls or contract reads
4. WHEN clicking transaction buttons THEN they SHALL correctly send transactions to smart contracts
5. WHEN transactions are submitted THEN the system SHALL properly handle and display responses
6. WHEN viewing charts and metrics THEN they SHALL display real-time or actual historical data

### Requirement 3: Complete User Flow Validation

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge evaluating the AION platform, I want to experience a seamless user journey from homepage to final interaction, so that I can properly assess the platform's functionality and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting from the homepage THEN the user SHALL be able to navigate through every page without errors
2. WHEN interacting with any button, form, or chart THEN it SHALL work with real data and provide appropriate feedback
3. WHEN performing transactions THEN the integration between contracts, backend, and MCP agent SHALL be seamless
4. WHEN completing any user action THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and update relevant data
5. WHEN navigating between pages THEN all state and data SHALL be properly maintained

### Requirement 4: Performance and Demo Optimization

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant presenting the AION platform, I want all pages to load quickly without errors and have a polished UI, so that the demo runs smoothly and impresses the judges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading any page THEN it SHALL load fast without performance issues
2. WHEN checking browser console THEN there SHALL be no warnings or errors
3. WHEN reviewing the UI THEN it SHALL appear professional and polished for demo presentation
4. WHEN testing the complete user flow THEN it SHALL execute smoothly without interruptions
5. WHEN preparing for demo THEN all integrations SHALL be verified as working with real data

### Requirement 5: Integration Architecture Validation

**User Story:** As a technical evaluator, I want to verify that the smart contracts, MCP agent, and frontend are properly integrated, so that I can confirm the platform's technical architecture is sound.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN smart contracts are called THEN the MCP agent SHALL properly interface with them
2. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN the MCP agent SHALL respond with accurate data
3. WHEN transactions are initiated THEN they SHALL flow correctly through all system layers
4. WHEN data is requested THEN it SHALL be retrieved from the appropriate source (contracts vs. agent)
5. WHEN system components communicate THEN error handling SHALL be robust and user-friendly
