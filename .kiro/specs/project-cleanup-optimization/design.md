# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines a systematic approach to clean up, optimize, and fully integrate the AION project for a professional hackathon demo. The approach involves four main phases: codebase analysis and cleanup, frontend integration verification, end-to-end testing, and final optimization. The design ensures that all components work with real data and provide a seamless user experience.

## Architecture

### Phase-Based Approach

The cleanup and optimization will follow a structured four-phase approach:

1. **Discovery and Cleanup Phase**: Identify and remove unused files, convert comments, eliminate redundancies
2. **Integration Verification Phase**: Ensure all frontend components use real data from contracts and MCP agent
3. **User Flow Testing Phase**: Test complete user journeys and fix any issues
4. **Optimization and Polish Phase**: Performance tuning and UI polish for demo readiness
