# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive automated testing and validation system for the AION Dashboard UI. The system will automatically navigate through all dashboard components, validate real-time data accuracy, test user workflows, and ensure professional quality that impresses hackathon judges. The system focuses on delivering seamless user experience with live data validation and comprehensive UI interaction testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated system that tests all dashboard components, so that I can ensure professional quality and real-time data accuracy for hackathon demonstrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the automated testing system runs THEN it SHALL navigate through all dashboard tabs and components including Wallet panel, Vault performance, Strategies Overview, Market Overview, Protocol Performance, Portfolio Metrics, AI panels, Risk Management, Gas tracker, Network status, History, Quick Stats, System Health, Alerts, and Recommendations
2. WHEN testing each component THEN the system SHALL interact with every button (Deposit, Withdraw, Execute, Refresh, Simulate, View All) and validate correct logic responses
3. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL verify all displayed information is real and up-to-date from blockchain or connected APIs
4. WHEN checking refresh functionality THEN the system SHALL ensure live refresh logic works correctly with automatic or manual refresh capabilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the system to validate all financial data and calculations, so that users see accurate APYs, balances, and performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating financial data THEN the system SHALL verify APYs, balances, vault shares, projections, and gas data match expected blockchain outputs
2. WHEN checking calculations THEN the system SHALL ensure performance metrics (APY, ROI, Risk Score) are calculated and displayed correctly
3. WHEN testing workflows THEN the system SHALL validate complete user journeys from Deposit → Execute → Metrics update are smooth and accurate
4. WHEN detecting issues THEN the system SHALL report broken links, missing data, stale content, or UI bugs with detailed error information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want AI recommendation validation and user journey simulation, so that the dashboard provides intelligent and seamless user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing AI features THEN the system SHALL verify AI Recommendations logic and triggers align with current market status and portfolio conditions
2. WHEN simulating user journeys THEN the system SHALL execute realistic workflows: Deposit → Strategy Allocation → Execution → Monitoring → Rebalance
3. WHEN completing validation THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive QA score and improvement suggestions
4. WHEN focusing on hackathon readiness THEN the system SHALL identify areas that can wow judging panels with professional presentation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated periodic testing and real-time monitoring, so that data freshness and system reliability are maintained continuously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scheduling tests THEN the system SHALL run automatically at configurable intervals to ensure continuous data freshness
2. WHEN monitoring live sync THEN the system SHALL verify real-time data synchronization between frontend and blockchain/APIs
3. WHEN detecting performance issues THEN the system SHALL measure and report response times, loading states, and system performance metrics
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create detailed test reports with pass/fail status, performance metrics, and actionable recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error detection and validation coverage, so that all edge cases and potential issues are identified before demonstrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL simulate network failures, API timeouts, and blockchain connection issues
2. WHEN validating edge cases THEN the system SHALL test boundary conditions, invalid inputs, and unexpected user behaviors
3. WHEN checking accessibility THEN the system SHALL ensure all components are accessible and follow best practices
4. WHEN verifying mobile responsiveness THEN the system SHALL test dashboard functionality across different screen sizes and devices
