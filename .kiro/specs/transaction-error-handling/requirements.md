# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing a comprehensive and professional error handling system for blockchain transactions in the AION vault application. The current transaction system lacks proper error categorization, user-friendly error messages, retry mechanisms, and detailed error logging. This enhancement will provide users with clear feedback about transaction failures and implement robust error recovery strategies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user making a deposit transaction, I want to receive clear and actionable error messages when something goes wrong, so that I can understand what happened and know how to resolve the issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction fails due to insufficient funds THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly message indicating the exact amount needed and current balance
2. WHEN a transaction fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display a message suggesting to check network connection and offer a retry option
3. WHEN a transaction fails due to contract revert THEN the system SHALL parse the revert reason and display a meaningful explanation to the user
4. WHEN a transaction fails due to gas estimation issues THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on adjusting gas settings
5. WHEN any transaction error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed technical information for debugging purposes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user experiencing transaction failures, I want the system to automatically retry failed transactions when appropriate, so that temporary network issues don't prevent my transactions from completing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction fails due to network timeout THEN the system SHALL automatically retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN a transaction fails due to nonce issues THEN the system SHALL refresh the nonce and retry once
3. WHEN a transaction fails due to gas price being too low THEN the system SHALL increase gas price by 10% and retry once
4. WHEN a transaction fails due to user rejection THEN the system SHALL NOT retry automatically
5. WHEN a transaction fails due to insufficient funds THEN the system SHALL NOT retry automatically
6. WHEN retrying a transaction THEN the system SHALL inform the user about the retry attempt and reason

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging transaction issues, I want comprehensive error logging and categorization, so that I can quickly identify and resolve system problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any transaction error occurs THEN the system SHALL categorize the error type (network, contract, user, gas, validation)
2. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL include transaction hash, block number, gas used, error code, and full error message
3. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL include user context like wallet address, chain ID, and transaction parameters
4. WHEN multiple errors occur THEN the system SHALL track error patterns and frequency
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL flag them for immediate attention

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the current status of my transaction with progress indicators, so that I know what's happening during the transaction process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction is initiated THEN the system SHALL show "Preparing transaction" status
2. WHEN waiting for user confirmation THEN the system SHALL show "Waiting for wallet confirmation" status
3. WHEN transaction is submitted THEN the system SHALL show "Transaction submitted" with transaction hash
4. WHEN waiting for confirmation THEN the system SHALL show "Confirming transaction" with block confirmations count
5. WHEN transaction is completed THEN the system SHALL show "Transaction completed" with success details
6. WHEN transaction fails THEN the system SHALL show "Transaction failed" with error details and suggested actions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user making deposits, I want the system to validate my transaction parameters before submission, so that I can avoid failed transactions due to invalid inputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user enters deposit amount THEN the system SHALL validate amount is greater than minimum deposit
2. WHEN user enters deposit amount THEN the system SHALL validate user has sufficient balance including gas fees
3. WHEN validating chain ID THEN the system SHALL ensure vault contract exists on the specified chain
4. WHEN validating vault address THEN the system SHALL verify the contract is valid and accessible
5. IF any validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent transaction submission and show specific validation error
6. WHEN all validations pass THEN the system SHALL allow transaction to proceed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications about my transaction status changes, so that I stay informed about the progress without constantly checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transaction status changes THEN the system SHALL update the local activity timeline
2. WHEN transaction is confirmed THEN the system SHALL show a success notification
3. WHEN transaction fails THEN the system SHALL show an error notification with retry option
4. WHEN transaction is taking longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show a warning notification
5. WHEN transaction is stuck THEN the system SHALL offer options to speed up or cancel the transaction
