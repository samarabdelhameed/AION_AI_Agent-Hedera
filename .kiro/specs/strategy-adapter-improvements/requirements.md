# Requirements Document - Strategy Adapter Layer Improvements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive Strategy Adapter Layer that will transform the current AION Vault system into a production-ready DeFi yield optimization platform. The goal is to create a unified interface for all yield strategies, implement proper yield tracking, and demonstrate real returns from integrated protocols.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Strategy Adapter Interface

**User Story:** As a DeFi user, I want all yield strategies to work through a consistent interface, so that I can trust the system's yield calculations and strategy switching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new strategy is deployed THEN it SHALL implement the IStrategyAdapter interface
2. WHEN a user deposits funds THEN the adapter SHALL return the exact number of shares minted
3. WHEN a user withdraws funds THEN the adapter SHALL burn shares and return the corresponding underlying assets
4. WHEN totalAssets() is called THEN it SHALL return the real-time value from the underlying protocol
5. WHEN estimatedAPY() is called THEN it SHALL return the current APY from the protocol's on-chain data

### Requirement 2: Real Protocol Integration

**User Story:** As an investor, I want to see actual yields from real DeFi protocols, so that I can verify the system's performance claims.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN funds are deposited to Venus strategy THEN they SHALL be actually supplied to Venus vBNB contract
2. WHEN funds are deposited to PancakeSwap strategy THEN they SHALL be added to a real liquidity pool
3. WHEN yield is calculated THEN it SHALL reflect the actual accrued interest/fees from the protocol
4. WHEN APY is displayed THEN it SHALL be fetched from the protocol's current supply rate
5. WHEN emergency withdrawal occurs THEN all funds SHALL be recovered from the actual protocols

### Requirement 3: Shares-Based Accounting System

**User Story:** As a vault user, I want my share of the vault to accurately represent my portion of the total assets, so that I receive fair yields.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user deposits THEN shares SHALL be calculated as: shares = amount * 1e18 / pricePerShare
2. WHEN totalAssets increases due to yield THEN pricePerShare SHALL increase proportionally
3. WHEN a user withdraws THEN they SHALL receive: amount = shares * pricePerShare / 1e18
4. WHEN multiple users deposit THEN each SHALL receive shares proportional to their contribution
5. WHEN yield accrues THEN it SHALL be distributed proportionally among all shareholders

### Requirement 4: Strategy Rebalancing System

**User Story:** As a vault manager, I want to move funds between strategies to optimize yields, so that users get the best possible returns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rebalance() is called THEN funds SHALL be withdrawn from source strategy
2. WHEN funds are moved THEN they SHALL be deposited to target strategy within the same transaction
3. WHEN rebalancing occurs THEN the total vault value SHALL remain constant (minus gas fees)
4. WHEN rebalancing fails THEN the transaction SHALL revert and funds SHALL remain in original strategy
5. WHEN rebalancing completes THEN a Rebalanced event SHALL be emitted with amounts and strategies

### Requirement 5: Real-Time Yield Tracking

**User Story:** As a DeFi user, I want to see my actual yield accumulation in real-time, so that I can track my investment performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN yield accrues in underlying protocols THEN it SHALL be reflected in totalAssets()
2. WHEN a user checks their balance THEN it SHALL show their current share value including yield
3. WHEN APY is calculated THEN it SHALL use actual yield data from the last 24 hours
4. WHEN yield is claimed THEN only the yield portion SHALL be withdrawn, preserving principal
5. WHEN multiple strategies are active THEN yield SHALL be aggregated across all positions

### Requirement 6: Venus Protocol Integration

**User Story:** As a BNB holder, I want to earn yield through Venus protocol, so that I can benefit from BNB lending rates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BNB is deposited THEN it SHALL be supplied to Venus vBNB contract
2. WHEN supply is successful THEN vBNB tokens SHALL be held by the strategy
3. WHEN yield is calculated THEN it SHALL use Venus exchangeRate and supply rate
4. WHEN withdrawal occurs THEN vBNB SHALL be redeemed for underlying BNB
5. WHEN Venus protocol fails THEN the strategy SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 7: PancakeSwap LP Integration

**User Story:** As a liquidity provider, I want to earn trading fees through PancakeSwap, so that I can benefit from AMM yields.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tokens are deposited THEN they SHALL be added to a PancakeSwap liquidity pool
2. WHEN liquidity is added THEN LP tokens SHALL be received and tracked
3. WHEN yield is calculated THEN it SHALL include trading fees accumulated
4. WHEN withdrawal occurs THEN LP tokens SHALL be burned for underlying assets
5. WHEN pool doesn't exist THEN the strategy SHALL handle the error appropriately

### Requirement 8: Comprehensive Testing Suite

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests that prove the system works with real protocols, so that I can deploy with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL use real protocol contracts on testnet
2. WHEN deposits are tested THEN actual protocol interactions SHALL be verified
3. WHEN yield is tested THEN real yield accumulation SHALL be measured over time
4. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN error handling SHALL be validated
5. WHEN integration tests run THEN end-to-end flows SHALL be verified

### Requirement 9: Gas Optimization

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious user, I want minimal gas costs for deposits and withdrawals, so that small transactions remain profitable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deposits occur THEN gas usage SHALL be under 200,000 gas
2. WHEN withdrawals occur THEN gas usage SHALL be under 150,000 gas
3. WHEN rebalancing occurs THEN it SHALL be batched to minimize gas costs
4. WHEN multiple operations are needed THEN they SHALL be combined when possible
5. WHEN gas optimization is implemented THEN it SHALL not compromise security

### Requirement 10: Event Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive event logging, so that I can monitor system health and user activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any deposit occurs THEN a StrategyDeposited event SHALL be emitted
2. WHEN any withdrawal occurs THEN a StrategyWithdrawn event SHALL be emitted
3. WHEN rebalancing occurs THEN a Rebalanced event SHALL be emitted
4. WHEN errors occur THEN appropriate error events SHALL be emitted
5. WHEN yield is calculated THEN yield tracking events SHALL be emitted
