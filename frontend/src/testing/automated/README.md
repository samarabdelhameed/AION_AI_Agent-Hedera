```

## Core Components

### TestOrchestrator
Central coordinator for managing test execution, scheduling, and reporting.

### UINavigator
Automated browser controller using Playwright for dashboard interaction.

### DataValidator
Real-time validation engine for blockchain and API data accuracy.

### WorkflowSimulator
User journey simulation engine for end-to-end testing.

### PerformanceMonitor
System performance and response time tracking.

## Configuration

The system is configured through `config/test-config.ts` which defines:
- Dashboard components to test
- User workflows to simulate
- Validation rules for data accuracy
- Performance thresholds
- Test environment settings

## Usage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all automated tests
npm run test:automated

# Run specific test suite
npx playwright test dashboard.spec.ts

# Run tests in headed mode (visible browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Generate test report
npx playwright show-report
```

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { TestOrchestrator } from './testing/automated';

const orchestrator = new TestOrchestrator();

// Start automated testing
const results = await orchestrator.startAutomatedTesting();

// Schedule periodic testing
orchestrator.schedulePeriodicTesting(3600000); // Every hour

// Generate report
const report = await orchestrator.generateReport();
```

## Requirements Covered

This implementation addresses the following requirements:

- **Requirement 1.1**: Automated navigation through all dashboard components
- **Requirement 4.1**: Test orchestration and scheduling infrastructure
- **Requirement 1.2**: UI interaction testing with buttons and components
- **Requirement 2.1**: Data validation against blockchain and API sources
- **Requirement 4.3**: Performance monitoring and metrics tracking

## Next Steps

The infrastructure is now ready for implementation of specific test cases in subsequent tasks:

1. Component testing implementation
2. Data validation logic
3. Workflow simulation
4. Performance monitoring
5. Report generation
6. Integration with existing AION systems

## Browser Support

The system supports testing across multiple browsers:
- Chromium (Chrome/Edge)
- Firefox
- WebKit (Safari)
- Mobile browsers (Chrome Mobile, Safari Mobile)

## Environment Setup

Ensure the following are installed:
- Node.js 16+
- Playwright browsers: `npx playwright install`
- AION Dashboard running on `http://localhost:5173`

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow the established patterns in existing test files
2. Use the provided interfaces and helper utilities
3. Add appropriate test selectors to components
4. Update configuration files as needed
5. Ensure tests are deterministic and reliable
